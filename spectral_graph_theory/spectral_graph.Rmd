## Introduction

A demonstration of how spectral graph theory can be used to better visualize graphs and be used to identify planar graphs (graphs that can be drawn with no overlapping edges). 

## An example using iGraph in R

The only library needed is the iGraph library for network analysis and visualization
```{r libraries}
library(igraph)
```


```{r graph_creation, echo=FALSE}
#example graph layout
g<-make_graph(c(1,6,1,2,1,5,1,4,2,3,2,4,2,9,3,8,3,9,4,7,4,8,5,6,5,9,6,7,7,8), directed = FALSE)
l<-matrix(c(3,7.5,7.5,7.25,2,7,6.5,6,0,2.5,6,4.5,8,3,0.5,1,7,0),9,2, byrow = TRUE)
```

Using a sample generated graph G, consisting of nodes and edges, we can see its difficult to determine whether the graph is planar
```{r plot graph}
plot.igraph(g,  layout = l)
```

First we can take the adjcency matrix of G, which shows which nodes are connected to each other
```{r adj_matrix}
adj <- as_adjacency_matrix(g)
adj
```

Then we can take the eigenvectors of this adjacency matrix
```{r eigenvectors}
ev<-eigen(adj)
vectors<-ev$vectors
vectors
```

Using the second and third eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix as cartesian coordinates for each node, we can plot the G with this layout. 

We can see that G is planar, and now G also becomes a much clearer, more practical graph to deal with.
```{r spectral_drawing}
v2<-vectors[,2]
v3<-vectors[,3]

v2<-vectors[,2]
v3<-vectors[,3]

j<-cbind(v2,v3)

plot.igraph(g, layout = j)
```
